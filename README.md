Resampling a NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) image involves changing its voxel dimensions, typically to match a desired resolution or spatial orientation. This is often necessary when you're combining images with different resolutions, analyzing data across different studies, or preparing data for specific analyses.
